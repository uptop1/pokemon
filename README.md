Pokemon RPG
===========

A simple RPG simulates Pokemon training adventure. It's a text based one runs on the console developed in PHP with symfony 3 framework. It's ready to be implemented in API or as a web application by calling PokemonGame class.

Hope you are going to enjoy the game as much I enjoyed building it.

Note
---------------
I do not usually use symfony framework nor doctrine, but I thought it's a great chance to try them so I built this game and I fell in love with symfony :D. If you find any issue, please inform me, I really appretiate feedbacks.

I know it's better to build the DB using migrations, but I had not time for this.
